In this post, we're going to take a look at how to make an image fade to transparent, or what I like to call _transparent image gradient_ with CSS.

## Table Of Contents

## Example

This is an example of the effect we're trying to achieve.

Notice how the bottom part of the image is slowly fading into the background, making it much easier to read the text on top of it.

## Solution

To achieve this effect, we'll need to use CSS masking, the `mask-image` property.

Basically, we're creating a mask layer on top of an image to partially or fully hide portions of the image.

_Note: As of the time of writing this article (September 2022), most browsers only have partial support for CSS masking. So we need to add the `-webkit-` prefix in addition to the standard property in most browsers._

Without further ado, here is the CSS that you need to apply to the image:

```css
.transparent-gradient {
	-webkit-mask-image: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(0, 0, 0, 1), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0));
	mask-image: linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(0, 0, 0, 1), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0));
}
```

You can also fine-tune the gradient direction by changing the first argument, and also the degree of transparency with the second and third arguments, more specifically, the `a` part of `rgba`, which stands for alpha (transparency).

## Wrap Up

That's it ðŸŽ‰. Hope you find it useful.
