You can use the (Network Information API)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NetworkInformation] to get information about the connection a device is using.

```js
console.log(navigator.connection)

// Prints
NetworkInformation {
  downlink: 10,
  effectiveType: "4g",
  onchange: null,
  rtt: 250,
  saveData: false
}
```
