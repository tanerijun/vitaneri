Here are some facts about me:

- I'm currently in Taiwan.
- I speak Chinese, English, Indonesian, and Hokkien.
- My expertise is the "web", where I employ JS/TS and an array of frameworks to craft seamless digital experiences.
- Beyond the digital realm, I'm an avid seeker of profound narratives that have the power to transform lives. There's nothing quite like getting lost in the pages of a compelling story that leaves an indelible mark.
