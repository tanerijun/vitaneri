Analogy of how OAuth works:

At a high level, the process is similar to sending a child home from school with a permission slip to go on a field trip. The teacher asks students if they want to go on a field trip. If they say yes, she sends them home with a paper for their parents to sign. Their parents then sign the permission slip and send the child back to school with it. Once the teacher receives the signed permission slip, the child can be taken on the field trip.
