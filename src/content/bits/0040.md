A Tailwind snippet to emulate [`.stretched-link` from Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/helpers/stretched-link/)

```html
<a class="before:absolute before:inset-0 before:z-0 before:overflow-hidden before:whitespace-nowrap before:indent-[100] before:content-['']">link</a>
```

Note:
- Make sure the parent element has position `relative` class
- Make sure the z-index value of the other nested links are bigger than 0
