Heuristics for optimizing React's performance:

1. If you can solve the problem by altering component hierarchy or state, prioritize that!
2. Memoization is a solid strategy _only_ if the cost of checking pays for itself with the time you save rendering.
3. Use Lazy/Suspense API to progressively load components.
4. Use the Transition API (`useTransition` / `useDeferredValue`) when you're _really_ in a pickle (e.g something is computationally expensive, but not running it is not a choice).
