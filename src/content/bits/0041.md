To remove a package in a Go project:

- Run `go get` and postfix the package path with `@none`.

  ```sh
  $ go get github.com/path/to/package@none
  ```

- Remove all references to the package in your code, then run `go mod tidy`, which will automatically remove any unused packages from your go.mod and go.sum files.

  ```sh
  $ go mod tidy -v
  ```
