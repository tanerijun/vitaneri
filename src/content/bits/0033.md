When to use `Object` VS `Map` in Javascript:

Use `Object` for records where you have a fixed and finite number of properties/fields known at author time, such as a config object or anything that is for one-time use in general.

Use `Map` for dictionaries or hash maps where you have a variable number of entries, with frequent updates, whose keys might not be known at author time, such as an [event emitter](https://github.com/developit/mitt/blob/main/src/index.ts#L45).

According to [benchmarks](https://www.zhenghao.io/posts/object-vs-map#performance-extravaganza), unless the keys are strings of small integers, `Map` is indeed more performant than `Object` on insertion, deletion and iteration speed, and it consumes less memory than an `Object` of the same size.
