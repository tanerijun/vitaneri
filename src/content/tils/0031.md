The accessibility inspector in Firefox exposes Geckoâ€™s accessibility tree rather than information from the platform accessibility layer.

An example of the result of this is `role="button"` showing up as `role="pushbutton"` instead.

To check how the internal roles are mapped to platform roles, look at the [source of truth](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/accessible/base/Role.h).
