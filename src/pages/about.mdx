Hi, my name is Vincent. I'm currently a student at LongHua University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, pursuing a B.E in Electronic Engineering.

From a very young age, I've always been interested in Tech and Science. Initially, I started coding out of curiosity, eventually it became a hobby, and then a passion.

I work to the principle that simple is beautiful, while carefully including the finest details and interactions. I'm a naturally curious person who is a tad bit obsessed with perfection and is perpetually seeking to learn and improve.

Another interesting fact about me: I speak Chinese, English, Indonesian, and Hokkien.
